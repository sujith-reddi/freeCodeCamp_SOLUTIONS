freeCodeCamp.org is an amazing initiative and an excellent, free resource helping thousands of people learn to code. This respository captures my personal solutions to a number of their various challenges and exercises.
I decided to publicly share the solutions with the intention of helping other students who might get stuck or who might want to see how someone else approached the same exercise and learn from their approach. Consult this repository only if you truly have no idea how to pass an exercise or to check if there is perhaps a better, simpler or more efficient way of solving it.
